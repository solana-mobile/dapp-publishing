# Why publish on the Solana dApp Store?

The Solana dApp Store is an app store for the Saga, a flagship Android phone from Solana Mobile designed for Web3. Saga also includes Seed Vault, a key custody solution for the Solana network. The Solana dApp Store offers the attention of engaged Web3-focused users of the Saga device, combined with [publisher policies](PUBLISHER-POLICY.md) compatible with crypto use-cases, such as NFTs, DeFi, payments, blockchain gaming, and more.

# How is the Solana dApp Store different?

## Friendly home for Web3 content

The Solana dApp Store welcomes Web3 content. Apps are allowed to let users buy, sell, and trade digital goods, participate in DeFi, token-gate experiences based on the contents of a usersâ€™ wallets, send and receive microtransactions, use the payment system of its choice, etc, freely, without policies preventing these uses, or requiring a portion of revenue be remitted to the app store.

## Fee-free

Solana Mobile Inc. does not collect any fees in-app purchases, app purchases, or subscriptions, nor are any fees collected on its behalf by apps in the catalog.

## Publishing vs. curation

With the Solana dApp Store, apps are published on-chain, represented by NFTs (representing the publisher, the app, and each release). These NFTs belong to the publisher who minted them - ownership of the private key for the minting account grants the right to publish new versions of that app. These NFTs describe each release of an app, and contain everything necessary to display the details of that app to users.

Once minted, an app publisher may submit the details of their app NFT to the Solana dApp publisher portal, for inclusion in the catalog. This catalog is curated by Solana Mobile Inc., based on our [publisher policies](PUBLISHER-POLICY.md).

# What is the process of publishing my app on the Solana dApp Store?

For technical details, please see our [publishing walkthrough guide](PUBLISHING.md), but at a high level, the process is the following:

1. Prepare your app for release. Make sure it complies with the Solana dApp Store [publisher policies](PUBLISHER-POLICY.md).
2. Fill in a configuration file, describing your app as you want it to appear in the Solana dApp Store catalog
3. Mint NFTs representing the publisher (i.e. you!), the app, and details of the specific release or version you are submitting to the dApp Store
4. Submit a publisher portal request for your new (or updated) release
5. Wait for a response. Watch your emails; we may have questions for you about your app.
6. Ta-da ðŸŽ‰. Your app is now listed in the Solana dApp Store catalog.
