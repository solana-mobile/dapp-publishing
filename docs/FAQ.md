# Frequently asked questions

**Q.** What does it mean for the Solana dApp Store to be “fee-free”?<br/>
**A.** Solana Mobile, Inc. does not collect any fees on in-app purchases, app purchases, or subscriptions, nor are any fees collected on its behalf by apps in the catalog. Users may incur fees from usage of apps contained within the catalog, such as network transaction fees.

**Q.** Can I charge for my app?<br/>
**A.** Absolutely! We’re exploring the addition of purchasing apps using token-gating directly within the Solana dApp Store. In the meantime, however, you are free to establish a direct economic relationship with your customers, on-chain or off.

**Q.** When will you start taking submissions for the Solana dApp Store?<br/>
**A.** We’re accepting submissions starting now!

**Q.** When do I need to have my app ready to be available when the Saga device launches?<br/>
**A.** We recommend you have your app ready and submitted for review to the dApp publisher portal by early March. This will give us time to review it to ensure it complies with our policies.

**Q.** How do I build an app so it’s more likely to be accepted on the Solana dApp Store?<br/>
**A.** We recommend you review the [Solana Mobile Stack](https://github.com/solana-mobile/solana-mobile-stack-sdk) Github and integrate it with the SDK that corresponds to your use case, in order to transact with wallets and dApps seamlessly.
