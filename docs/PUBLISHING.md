# Publishing to the Solana dApp Store

## Overview

Publishing a dApp to the Solana dApp Store involves the following:

1. Create a set of NFTs describing the dApp, publisher, and release on-chain.
1. Submit a request to the Solana dApp Store publisher portal requesting that Solana Mobile team review the dApp's release NFT.

The publishing tool is designed for CI/CD usage - all steps, including submitting publish portal requests, can be integrated into your dApp release workflows. All files used during the NFT creation and publishing request submission steps can be committed to source control.

## Setup

Please follow the instructions in [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) to get setup with the publishing CLI tooling.

## RPC endpoints

By default, the `dapp-store` CLI interacts with **Devnet**. This facilitates experimentation and testing, before you are ready to publish your dApp on Mainnet Beta. To publish to Mainnet Beta, add the `-u <mainnet_beta_rpc_url>` parameter to all commands below. 

If you have a private RPC URL, it is **strongly** recommended that you use it. If you do not yet have a private RPC URL, you can make use of the [public endpoint](https://docs.solana.com/cluster/rpc-endpoints#mainnet-beta) (but be cognizant of the rate and usage limits).

## Step-by-step walkthrough of dApp publishing

### Where do the asssets & files for my dApp go?

It is recommended that you put your dApp publishing files next to your dApp, and source control them together. This guide assumes that your dApp is built with Android Studio, and the root directory for the project which builds your APKs is `${APP_ROOT}`.

### Configure the publishing details for your dApp

#### 1. Collect your publishing assets

Having followed the instructions in [SETUP.md](SETUP.md), collect the file paths for all your publishing assets (e.g., APK file, icons, screenshot images) relative to the directory that was  just created.

Some best practices for the assets & files you'll be providing:

- Icon(s) should be 512px by 512px dimensions.
- We recommend screenshot/preview images to be 1080p resolution (1920px by 1080px).
- You may choose portrait or landscape orientation for your images, we only ask that all the images you provide have consistent orientation.
- Make sure your dApp APK is localized properly, and that your build.gradle file identifies the languages & locales that your dApp supports. See [the Android developer documentation](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/multilingual-support#specify-the-languages-your-app-supports) for more details.

#### 2. Populate the configuration file

Populate the initial contents of the configuration file created during setup. By default, the file name is `config.yaml`. Replace all fields in `<< >>` with details for your dApp. Remove any fields that don't apply (for e.g., `saga_features`, `google_store_package`, etc).

There are 3 sections to fill out: `publisher`, `app`, and `release`:

- The `publisher` section describes you, the app developer. 
- The `app` section represents a single logical app produced by a publisher. A single publisher will always have at least one app, but if you publish multiple different apps under a single identity, there will be one for each of your apps. 
- The `release` section is the most important, and describes all the metadata for a single release of an app, including its display name, description, icons, screenshots, etc. The text you enter in the `catalog` subsection, along with the icon and screenshots in the `media` subsections, are what application stores will use to display details about your app to the end user, so be as descriptive as you can.

**IMPORTANT:** Each of the above regions of the configuration file have an `address` field. You do not need to modify this field nor should you remove it from the configuration file.

_NOTE: You may need to provide details in the `testing_instructions` field of the configuration file that you would not want published on-chain. Rest assured, this data is not published as part of the on-chain metadata._.

#### 3. Localization of store details (Optional)

The configuration file allows for localization of the details/copy you provide that describes your app. To be clear, this localized text is different from the strings localized *within your app itself*. Localized store details will be presented to users browsing dApp stores based on the locale they have chosen on their device. If a user's device is set to a locale you have provided, they will be presented that localized text.

As a tangible example, here's how you would localize details strings for French (France). This would be placed at the same hierarchical level alongside the default `en-US` locale text:

   ```
   release:
     catalog:
       fr-FR:
         name: >-
           <<NAME_OF_APP_IN_FRENCH_(FRANCE)>>
         short_description: >-
           <<SHORT_APP_DESCRIPTION_IN_FRENCH_(FRANCE)>>
         long_description: >-
           <<LONG_APP_DESCRIPTION_IN_FRENCH_(FRANCE)>>
         new_in_version: >-
           <<WHATS_NEW_IN_THIS_VERSION_IN_FRENCH_(FRANCE)>>
         saga_features: >-
           <<ANY_FEATURES_ONLY_AVAILBLE_WHEN_RUNNING_ON_SAGA_IN_FRENCH_(FRANCE)>>
   ```

### Create a keypair for your dapp

**IMPORTANT: this keypair is a critical secret for your dApp. Whomever possesses it is able to create new releases of your dApp and submit them to the Solana dApp Store. It should be safeguarded with appropriate technical measures.**

See the [File System Wallet](https://docs.solana.com/wallet-guide/file-system-wallet) instructions to create a new keypair for publishing your dApp. You'll need to fund your account with some SOL to mint the necessary publisher, dApp, and release NFTs. For testing purposes, you can use devnet or testnet, and airdrop some SOL to this wallet.

### Validate your configuration

To validate the details you have provided in your configuration file, use:

```
npx dapp-store validate -k <path_to_your_keypair> -b <path_to_your_android_sdk_build_tools>
```

On success, you should see output similar to:

```
Publisher JSON valid!
App JSON valid!
Release JSON valid!
```

### Mint the NFTs

#### 1. Create the publisher NFT

   ```
   npx dapp-store create publisher -k <path_to_your_keypair> [-u <mainnet_beta_rpc_url>]
   ```
   _NOTE: this is a one-time operation. Once you have created your publisher, the mint address is recorded in your configuration file_.

#### 2. Create the dApp NFT
   ```
   npx dapp-store create app -k <path_to_your_keypair> [-u <mainnet_beta_rpc_url>]
   ```

   _NOTE: this is a one-time operation. Once you have created your dApp, the mint address is recorded in your configuration file_.

#### 3. Create the release NFT

   ```
   npx dapp-store create release -k <path_to_your_keypair> -b <path_to_your_android_sdk_build_tools> [-u <mainnet_beta_rpc_url>]
   ```

   _NOTE: this will be repeated each time you have a new version of your dApp to release. The mint address of the latest release is recorded in your configuration file_.
   > **Warning**: on this step make sure your network is reliable and has a minimum upload speed of 0.25 megabytes per second.

### Submit your dApp

After minting a complete set of NFTs (publisher, dApp, and release) to represent your dApp on-chain, you may choose to submit them to the Solana dApp Publisher Portal, as a candidate for inclusion in the Solana dApp Store catalog.

```
npx dapp-store publish submit -k <path_to_your_keypair> -u <mainnet_beta_rpc_url> --requestor-is-authorized --complies-with-solana-dapp-store-policies
```

The two flags for this command (`--requestor-is-authorized` and `--complies-with-solana-dapp-store-policies`) are attestations from the requestor that this dApp is compliant with Solana dApp Store policies, and that they are authorized to submit this request to the Solana dApp Publisher Portal. 

After submitting, please check the email address specified in the `publisher` section of your configuration file; you will receive correspondence from the Solana dApp Publisher Portal to that account.

### What files should I commit to source control?

You should source control `.asset-manifest.json`, your configuration file, and any other files you would like to store alongside the publishing configuration (for e.g., icon and screenshot media files). These files should be committed each time you mint new NFT(s) for your dApp; the history of these files will serve as a record of all the NFTs ever minted to represent your dApp.

**IMPORTANT: Do NOT commit your keypair directly to source control. If your CI/CD environment has the capability to manage secrets, you can use this to manage and deploy the keypair for use in your publishing workflow.**

## Publishing subsequent dApp releases

Publishing subsequent releases of your dApp to the Solana dApp Store involves the following steps:

### 1. Create an updated APK file

Each release of your dApp will require an updated APK file. It is important that each new APK file include the following updates:

- The `versionName` value in `build.gradle` must be updated from the previou release. This field can be set to arbitrary values.
- The `versionCode` value in `build.gradle` must be incremented by one monotonically between each update.

You can learn more about APK versioning in the [Android developer docs](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning).

### 2. Update your configuration file

Edit the `release` and `solana_mobile_dapp_publisher_portal` sections of your configuration file to reflect any changes. Be sure to include `new_in_version` details so users can know what to expect with the update!

### 3. Mint a new release NFT

The Solana dApp store requires each new release of your dApp to be minted as a release NFT with all the changes discussed in this section.

Run the same CLI command as the "Create the release NFT" step from the [Mint the NFTs](#mint-the-nfts) section in this documentation.

### 4. Submit an update to the Publisher Portal

Submit the update to the Solana dApp Publisher Portal, where the new release will enter a review queue for inclusion in the dApp store catalog. Use the following command: 

   ```
   npx dapp-store publish update -k <path_to_your_keypair> -u <mainnet_beta_rpc_url> --requestor-is-authorized --complies-with-solana-dapp-store-policies
   ```
