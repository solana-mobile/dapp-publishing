# Welcome publishers!

We’re glad you’re ready to learn about publishing your Web3 apps on the Solana dApp Store, the fee-free app store for the [Saga](https://solanamobile.com/saga) device.

What do we mean by fee-free? We mean that no fees are collected by Solana Mobile Inc. from users of the dApp Store. There may still be network transaction fees or app-specific fees associated with usage of the Solana dApp Store, or of apps installed by it. None of these fees are collected by, or on behalf of, Solana Mobile Inc.

# Getting started

## 1. Read the publisher policies

We’ve created the Solana dApp Store to be the best home for Web3 and crypto apps. Our [policies](docs/PUBLISHER-POLICY.md) exist to protect users from illegal, harmful, and misleading content, without restricting the abilities of apps to use crypto features, like trading NFTs or other digital goods.

All apps submitted to the Solana dApp Store must comply with these policies. If you have concerns about an app in the Solana dApp Store catalog, please report it to [concerns@dappstore.solanamobile.com](mailto:concerns@dappstore.solanamobile.com).

## 2. Read the Solana dApp Store Developer Agreement

Make sure to read and understand the [Solana dApp Store Developer Agreement](docs/DEVELOPER-AGREEMENT.pdf). These terms apply to all submissions made to the Solana dApp Store publisher portal.

## 3. Publish

Publishing your app to the Solana dApp Store involves two steps - minting NFTs representing your app on-chain, and submitting a request to the publisher portal to have your app listed in the catalog.

Check out the [publishing walkthrough guide](docs/PUBLISHING.md) for step-by-step instructions on how to mint an app’s NFTs and submit publisher portal requests.

## 4. Wait for a decision on your app

After submitting, we’ll review your app against our [policies](docs/PUBLISHER-POLICY.md). Please make sure to provide a valid email address, so that we can reach out to you with any questions about your submission.
